** Analyzing Shuffles
#+begin_src bash
forge build  
anvil --gas-limit 300000000
cargo run --release --bin reveal
#+end_src

The =reveal= runs about 40 iterations at a time. Somehow anvil
struggles with RAM for large iterations.

You can already see a data set of shuffles in [[./data/shuffles.csv]].
There is an associated notebook: [[./data/shuffles.ipynb]] that tries to
analyse the data.

Here's an attempt at visualizing a 600 subset sample of the shuffle:

There is also some attempt to visualize subsets of some shuffles.
